The purpose of this document is to ensure efficiency of the design process while imposing product qualities compatible with the company’s values. The document defines principles to be used in the process of designing the product, and should inform all decisions to be made in the design process.

For the purposes of this document we distinguish:

The CLIENT - the company implementing Blindnet software in its software solutions. Also the implementing solution;

From the USER - the end user of the CLIENT

## 1. Minimal Friction Principle

Any decision related to the product should be taken in such a way to allow the product to deliver its intended functionality while generating minimal friction. 

This implies that product design options are considered in the following order:

FIRST: Options that have no implications to the client’s nor to the user’s workflow. If such options exist, then no other options are taken into consideration.

SECOND: Options that have no implications to the user’s workflow, but do have implications to the client’s software design, architecture and therefore workflow. 

THIRD: if and only if no option exists of FIRST and SECOND type, can options having an implication to the users’ workflow be considered.

## 2. Minimal Decision Principle

The user should not have to make choices regarding options or functionalities that are of no use to him. Ideally, the existence of functionalities and options should come to the user’s attention when and only when the user needs them.
