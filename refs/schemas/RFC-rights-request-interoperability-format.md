## Objective

We propose a simple, structured data format for representing [Rights Requests](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/master/refs/high-level-conceptualization#data-capture--rights-requests).

Rights Requests exist within the relationship between an individual and software systems (and organisations operating them) treating data that concerns that individual. 

Systems MAY process and respond to Rights Request by legal obligation, or as a simple courtesy in the pursuit of gaining and maintaining the individual's trust.

## Motivation

Different systems, and different compontents of a single system, including different comnponents of blindnet devkit are likely to exchange information about Rights Requests.

Therefore, a common format is needed to facilitate exchange of information without loss of semantics. 

Our goal is to establish a shared semantics of Rights Request so that their processing can be, as much as possible, automatised by the Systems.

## Design Considerations

The design also aimes to maximise:
- Consistent Interpretation of Rights Request accorss different Systems
- Automatisation of Rights Request Processing
- Confidentialty of data
- Compatibility with the use of different protocols and tools for:
    - user identity management and authentication,
    - encryption.



## Terminology

>**TO BE Updated** once Lexicon and High Level Conceptualization are synchronised

- We use the terms Rights Request, Data Subject, System as defined in [High Level Conceptualization](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/master/refs/high-level-conceptualization/README.md)
- We use the terms Rights Request and Data Rights Request interchangeably
- We use MUST, MUST NOT and MAY, as defined in [IETF RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)
- We use all the terms from the [Lexicon](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/devkit-schemas/refs/privateform-lexicon.csv) as defined there.


## Proposal

### Rights Request

Data Subjects is the author of a Rights Request.

| Schema propery | JSON Type | Expected cardinality | Expected values |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| `data-subject` | [array](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 1-* | An array of objects, each containing a (`dsid`,`dsid-schema`) pair |

An array of one or more [Data Subject Identities](#decentralized-identity-of-data-subjects) MUST be provided in order to match the Data Subject with the data concerning them.

In addition, the Rights Request has other meta-data:

| Schema propery | JSON Type | Expected cardinality | Expected values |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| `request-id` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 1 | Unique ID for referening to this request in the [uuid](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html) format |
| `date` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 1-* | Date and Time when Rights Request was created in JSON Schema [date-time](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.7.3.1) format |
| `language` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-1 | **TBD format** Language of textual message associated with demands |

The Data Subject can request several things (e.g. see the data the System has on me, know the source from where you have got it, and have my data deleted). We call those 'Demands'.

A Rights Request includes an array of one or more Demands.

#### Demands

A Demand is a concrete action that the user requests.

| Schema propery | JSON Type | Expected cardinality | Expected values |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| `demande-id` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 1 | Unique ID for referening to this demande in the [uuid](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html) format |
| `action` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 1 | **TBD** |
| `data-categories` | [array](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-* | Optional array of strings indicating particular categories of data to which the demand is limited to. See [Demand Restrictions](#demand-restrictions) for reserved values. |
| `treatment` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-1 | **TBD**|
| `consent-ids` | [array](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-* | Optional array of consent ids to indicate that the Demand (e.g. a `REVOQUE-CONSENT` Demand) is restricted to particular consents. Items of the array are strings in the [uuid](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html) format |
| `capture-ids` | [array](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-* | Optional array of Data Capture IDs to indicate that the Demand (e.g. a `DELETE` Demand) is restricted to data captured within particular Data Captures. Items of the array are strings in the [uuid](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html) format |
| `legal-grounds`| [array](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-* | Optional array of strings represented legal grounds that support the Demand. E.g. "GDPR.13" indicates Article 13 of GDPR, "CCPA.C" indicates Section C of CCPA |
| `message` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-1 | Optional comment, motivation or explanation of Demand |

##### Demand Restrictions

A Demand MAY be restricted to one or more data categories. For example, a Data Subject can request to access to all data concerning his location.

| Schema propery | JSON Type | Expected cardinality | Expected values |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| `data-category` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-* | One of {`NAME`, `CONTACT`, `CONTACT.EMAIL`, `CONTACT.ADDRESS`, `CONTACT.PHONE`, `UID`, `FINANCIAL`, `HEALTH`, `IMAGE`, `LOCATION`, `DEVICE`, `BEHAVIOR`, `BEHAVIOR.CONNECTION`, `BEHAVIOR.ACTIVITY`,  `BEHAVIOR.PREFERENCE`, `PROFILING`, `OTHER`} |

When several values are given, Systems MUST interpret the `data-category` restriction as a union of all the categories indicated. 

Categories are organised as a hierarchy, denoted with a full-stop ".", the more general category being written on the left. E.g. the following two `data-category` restrictions are equivalent:
- `CONTACT`,`CONTACT.EMAIL`
- `CONTACT`

In the absence of indication of any `data-category` restriction, Systems MUST interpret the Demand as being related to all categories of data.


#### Transitive Rights Request

A Rights Request can be transitive.
Transitive Rights Requests are usefull in a distributed context where System A gave information about the Data Subject to System B, and System B gave information about the Data Subject to System C.

When a System receives a transitive Rights Request, it SHOULD not only respond to it, but also transfer it to corresponding Systems with which it exchnaged data about the Data Subject.

| Schema propery | JSON Type | Expected cardinality | Expected values |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| `transitivity` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-1 | One of {`DOWNWARD`, `UPWARD`, `BIDIRECTIONAL`, `INTRANSITIVE`} |

Transitivity of Rights Requests can be `DOWNWARD` `UPWARD`, `BIDIRECTIONAL` or `INTRANSITIVE`. In the absence of any indication `INTRANSITIVE` SHOULD be assumed.

When System B receives a `DOWNWARD` transitive Rights Request, it MUST also send it to all systems to which it tranfered data about the Data Subject (System C).
When System B receives a `UPWARD` transitive Rights Request, it MUST also send it to all systems from which it obtained data about the Data Subject (System A).
When System B receives a `BIDIRECTIONAL` transitive Rights Request, it MUST also send it to all systems from which it obtained data about the Data Subject or to which it gave information about the Data Subject (System A and System C).
When System B receives an `INTRANSITIVE` Rights Request, it SHOULD NOT transfer it to any other system.

Systems should interpret the transitivity of Rights Request the same way regardless of the Rights Request being received directly from the Data Subject or from a corresponding System.

Convenient tables of Transitivity vlaues and corresponding user-facing descriptions, in different languages, are provided [here](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/devkit-schemas/refs/schemas/dictionary/transitivity/).

#### Reply-to

In a distributed context, where one System transmits the Rights Request to another System, a `reply-to` field MAY be specified.

| Schema propery | JSON Type | Expected cardinality | Expected values |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| `reply-to` | [string](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#page-6) | 0-1 | One of {`SYSTEM`, `USER`} |

`SYSTEM` indicates that the [scenario of nested responses](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/master/refs/high-level-architecture#scenario-1---nested-responses) is prefered. The System having registered the Rights Request from the Data Subject gathers responses and presents them to the Data Subject.

`USER` indicated the [scenario of direct responses](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/master/refs/high-level-architecture#scenario-2---direct-responses) is prefered. Each System having received a Rights Request is expected to reply directly to the Data Subject, using contact information it has.

### User Impact

**TBD**- What are the user-facing changes? How will this feature be rolled out?

## Detailed Design

### JSON format

In addition to this specification document we provide a JSON Schema document (link soon), for machine-readable interpretation of Rights Requests compliant with [v4 (or ideally lower) of IETF specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04#:~:text=JSON%20Schema%20is%20a%20JSON,interaction%20control%20of%20JSON%20data.)

The key requirements of the design are to enable:
- Unambiguous expression of Rights Requests in a machine-readable form
- Integrity of Rights Requests semantics when exchanged between components and systems. 
I.e. A system that has not directly collected the Rights Requests from the user, but has received in in JSON format from another system, can make the exact same interpretation of the request as if it had collected the request directly.
- A way of uniquely identifying one and the same Rights Request across systems and components concerned by it.

### Authenticated exchanges

Systems exchanging Rignts Requests MUST be able to do so in a way allowing them to very the integrity of their content, and the identity of the system having emitted the Rignts Request.

For this purposes Rignts Requests MAY be embedded as 'Claims' in [JWTs (FRC7519)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519).

### Decentralized Identity of Data Subjects

The Systems are only able to provide control to Data Subjects if they can identify them. On the other hand, there is no cetnral authority to manage Data Subject identity globally. 

Therefore, we use a set of atributes to uniquely indenitfy one Data Subject. One and the same Data Subject can have multiple such identities.

#### Globaly Unique Data Subject Identities

The identifiers used to refer to Data Subjects MUST be globaly unique. One Data Subject identity corresponds to one Data Subject. One Data Subject can have several Data Subject Identity.

When refering to a Data Subject, Systems MUST use both of the following atributes:
- `dsid` - Data Subject ID
- `dsid-schema` - A scheme allowign to dereference the Data Subject ID

The (`dsid`,`dsid-schema`) pair denotes a globaly unique reference to always the same Data Subject.

We refer to (`dsid`,`dsid-schema`) pairs as Data Subject Identities.

A Rights Request MAY include several (`dsid`,`dsid-schema`) pairs that refer to the same user, in order to facilitate the interoperability of Rights Requests across systems.

#### Data Subject ID Schemas

Systems using RRIF MUST implement at least the following `dsid-schema`:

|`dsid-schema` value | Interpretation of the corresponding `dsid` value |
| ------------------- | ---- |
|`uuid`| Indicates that the value of the corresponding `dsid` attribute is a Universaly Unique ID in the sens of [IETF RFC4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html) |

Systems using RRIF SHOULD implement at the following `dsid-schema`:

|`dsid-schema` value | Interpretation of the corresponding `dsid` value |
| ------------------- | ---- |
|`email-sha-256`| Indicates that the value of the corresponding `dsid` attribute is the result of the SHA-256 hashing function taking the e-mail of the Data Subject as argument |

Additional Data Subject ID Schemes MAY be definied by convention. For example the following MAY be used:

|`dsid-schema` value | Interpretation of the corresponding `dsid` value |
| ------------------- | ---- |
|`global-id`| Indicates that the value of the corresponding `dsid` attribute is the `gid_name` - User's GlobaliD name - used to identify the Data Subject in [GlobalId](https://developer.global.id/documentation/api%2Fidentity.html)|

#### Data Subject SHOULD be Authenticated

In some cases, valid reasons MAY exist for Systems to respond to Rights Requests even from anonymous Data Subjects. This is the case, for example, with request relative to general data treatment practices practiced by the system.

However, in most cases, Systems MUST require the Data Subject to be authenticated as being indeed the person corresponding to the (`dsid`,`dsid-schema`) pair.

When processing Rights Request, Systems MAY automatically disregard the (`dsid`,`dsid-schema`) paris for which they have not been able to establish Data Subject authentication.

However, the authentication does not necessairly have to be performed during the collection of the Rights Request. It can be done separately.

#### Matching Multiple Data Subject Identities

Systems MAY keep track of Data Subject Identities that refer to the same Data Subject. In some cases, valid reasons MAY exist for Systems to ignore such information.

When Systems do know that one Data Subject Identity corresponds to the same user as another Data Subject Identity, then Systems SHOULD offer the Data Subject a possibility for their Rights Requests, expressed in relation to one Data Subject Identity to be automatically extended to include other equivalent Data Subject Identities.

Systems SHOULD NOT imply Data Subject Identity equivalence from Rights Requests, especially when granding Rights Requests that require authentication.

### Data Capture IDs, Data Capture Fragment IDs, Consent IDs, Rights Request IDs, Demand IDs, Rights Request Respons IDs are Globally Unique

All of the following identifiers `data-capture-id`, `fragment-id`, `consent-id`, `rights-request-id`, `demand-id`, `rights-response-id` MUST be globally unique and be generated according to the [IETF RFC4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html) in order for the corresponding objects to be easily identifiable across systems.

### Remembering Transfers

When data about Data Subjects is transmitted from one system to another, in order to be able to process [Transitive Rights Requests](#transitive-rights-request), Systems MUST keep track of:
- System of destination/origin and addresses where their APIs can be reached
- Categories of data being trasnfered
- Identifiers (`data-capture-id`s,`fragment-id`s) associated to the data being trasnfered
- Consents (`consent-id`) associated to the data being trasnfered
- Data Subject Identities (`dsid`,`dsid-schema`) pairs associated to the data being trasnfered

> **Note**
> 
> Systems that exchange Data Subject information with other Systems MUST:
> - expose an API for communicating with other systems about Rights Requests:
>     - receiving Rights Requests from those other Systems,
>     - receiving Rights Request Responses from other Systems in the case of [Nested Responses Scenario](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/tree/devkit-schemas/refs/high-level-architecture#different-rights-request-response-scenrarios).


## Questions and Discussion Topics

### Use UUID for identifying Data Subjects

We chould immagine an alternative design, where we would force systems to use an [UUID]([uuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) (according to the [IETF RFC4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html)), to identify the users. That would require us to provide some way for systems to match UUIDs with their local IDs (usernames, or e-mails), and would ponteltially limit the ability of 3rd party systems to interprete Rights Request made at another system. This goal of proposed design is to allow for flexibility. However it is a very important aspect of the proposal, that deserves further debate.

### Mandatory properties and value constrains

Should we include rescritions in the schema according to the [JSON-schema-validation vocabulary](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-00#page-4) in order to make certian properties mandatory and ensure to limit string values to the values we suppoort? 

In the curent proposal, this is the case for Transitivity, but not for request types, data categories, and user identity schemas. We might want to include more forma constraints there, or deliberately leave flexibility. This is a discussion we need to have.
