## Introduction



## Motivation



## Terminology

- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)
- The key word "CAN" denotes ability of someone or something, and is interpreted as "MUST be able to"
- The key words "blindnet devkit", "CCPA", "CPRA", "Capture Fragment", "Component", "Data Capture", "Data Capture Fragment", "Data Consumer", "Data Subject", "DPO", "Fragment", "GDPR", "HIPPA", "Internet User", "Organization", "Privateform", "Privacy Request", "System", "Submitter", "User" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-Lexicon-2](../lexicon/RFC-Lexicon-2.md)
- Any additional precision about the key words defined in [RFC-Lexicon-2](../lexicon/RFC-Lexicon-2.md), as well as additional key words such as "Consent" and "Legal Base", provided in [High Level Conceptualization](../high-level-conceptualization/) is to be considered normative
- All key words denoting components of [blindnet devkit](../lexicon/RFC-Lexicon-2.md#blindnet-devkit), such as "Capture Component", "Encryption and Access Management Engine", "Privacy Computation Engine", "Privacy Compiler", "Privacy Request Capture Interface", "Customization API", "Data Consumer Interface", "Schemas" and "Storage Component" are to be interpreted as defined in [High Level Architecture](../high-level-architecture/)
