# Notions of Privacy

> The purpose of this document is to list definitions of privacy and related notions, sourced from literature, and provide fundamental understanding about the key concepts of interest for blindnet.
>
> We are interested in privacy from a perspective of builders of computer systems, who have to account for the human, its psychology and relationships with other humans and with the machines.
>
> In this document, we are not interested in the general perspectives related to politics, democracy and justice other than those views and findings that directly impact the building of a software system made for humans.

## Definition

Among the many definitions proposed in scientific literature, we use the following one:

> « **Privacy is the selective control of access to the self** » &msdash; _Irwin Altman[^1]_

This definition captures the essential features of the concept, in particular:

- Privacy is about the **self**.

The _self_ is a very important element of human experience playing _"an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and social identity"_[^2].

The self is not the same as identity.
While the _self is the totality of the individual_[^3], the _identity is an individual's sense of self defined by (a) a set of physical, psychological, and interpersonal characteristics that is not wholly shared with any other person and (b) a range of affiliations (e.g., ethnicity) and social roles_[^4].

Some scientists challenge the ability of an individual to know the _self_.
Under this view the self might only be intelligible through its manifestations or consequences.
It is generally accepted that the self is developed over time.
Also, undoubtedly, in part _"the self emerges through interaction with others"_[^5].

Due to the relational provenance of the knowledge of the self, privacy is one of the key features of the relationship of oneself with the surrounding world (other humans and artefacts) through which the knowledge of the self is formed.
Privacy is a "factor of connection to oneself and to others"[^6].

- Privacy is about **control of access**.

As relationships play a key role in shaping the view on the self, it is of crucial importance for the individual to control the access to self, and thus maintain control over their own view of the self.

- Privacy is **selective**.

It is not an absolute binary "come in" vs. "go away".
It is a nuanced choice to control access to parts of the _self_.

## Function

### Privacy Enables Connection

Privacy seems to trace its origins in biological processes.
"Withdrawal from others is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom" [^7].
Researchers make an analogy with cell membrane[^1] that selectively allows material inputs and outputs, similarly as privacy selectively regulates external stimulation to one's self or the flow of information to others[^7].

Biology research suggests that, in social species, privacy might have emerged as the cost-benefit balance between the advantages offered by the life in a group and the interests of the individual's competition over scarce resources. In other words, **privacy balances the dangers and advantages of connection**, which makes connection possible.

The practice of withholding information or actively sending deceiving signals might have had origins in a survival mechanism i.e. sending away the individuals competing for the same resources.
_"By increasing another individual's misinformation about the environment, an animal may increase its own fitness"_[^7].

In such primitive groups, privacy emerges as a strategy to establish **information asymmetry**[^8] and compensate for the power disbalance among individuals.
It is thus possible that the need for privacy in modern society remains still linked to the power differential.
Without privacy and the information asymmetry it creates, an individual is made vulnerable and its ability to ensure fitness for survival is diminished.

Compelling animals to remain in contact contrary to their own privacy inclinations, in laboratory settings, has resulted in physiological changes, reproductive failure and adrenal dysfunction[^7].

Beyond the privacy of an individual, privacy also has a group-preserving function in the relationship between one group to another[^15].

### Connection equals Humans' Survival

Humans are social species, hardwired for connection.

> « **Connection is the energy that exists between people when they feel seen, heard and valued; when they can give and receive without judgement; and when they derive sustenance and strength from the relationship.** » &mdash; _Brené Brown_

Connection is crucial to development; without it, social animals experience distress and face severe developmental consequences[^10]. 
But, connection also has the potential to expose the individual to existential vulnerabilities. 
Privacy makes connection possible, by managing the risk associated to it. 
Without privacy, the need for connection conflicts with the goal of protecting vital interests.

<img width="900" alt="connectedness" src="./img/connectedness.png">

Privacy is not the opposite of connectedness. 

Connectedness exists on the continuum between fusion and isolation.
Fusion is the state of total absence of boundaries and separateness. 
Isolation is the psychological equivalent of death. 
It leads to loneliness - correlated with negative effects on health[^11].

Humans need connectedness to avoid isolation. Privacy regulates connectedness to avoid fusion (where there is not enough separateness for anything to need connecting).

### Privacy Works Through Information Asymmetry

Information asymmetry[^8] is clearly a key concept for privacy as identified by biological studies of privacy in animal societies.

In the context of a power differential, where an individual interacts with a more powerful entity, the need for management of information asymmetry is twofold:

- reduce the information given by the less powerfull
- increase the transparency about what the more powerful does with the information obtained.[^9]

Indeed, in order to selectively control the access to self, the individual has to know what the other party will do if given access to a part of the self.
This two-way understanding of the information asymmetry that privacy seeks to create is the ground on which the legislation around _data minimization_, _transparency of treatment_ and _consent_ is formed.

## Consequences

As a key element of connection to others, privacy also impacts our connection to ourselves and our idea of our identity and self-efficacy. Functioning privacy creates a fertile ground for building trust and functional connectedness. Disfunctioning privacy is linked with despair.

### Privacy Influences Identity

As we derive the knowledge of self from our relationships with others, the freedom to engage and disengage from those relationships and selectively allow access to self is crucial to our ability to keep our identity safe.

At the psychological level:

- privacy supports social interaction,
- social interaction provides feedback on our competence to deal with the world,
- our competence to deal with the world affects our self-definition[^1][^16].

Inability to obtain privacy has important psychological consequences ranging from embarrassment and stigma to de-individuation and dehumanization[^16].

### Where There is Privacy There Can be Trust

> « **Trust is choosing to make something important to you vulnerable to the actions of someone else.** » &mdash; _Charles Feldman_[^20]

Privacy is strongly linked with trust.
Because privacy is about the access to _self_, and self is clearly of great importance, an individual is expected to choose a particular level of privacy in relation to the level of trust.

### Where there is No Privacy, There is Privacy Fatigue

Privacy fatigue reflects a sense of weariness toward privacy issues, in which individuals believe that there is no effective means of managing their personal information on the internet[^21].

This fatigue, brought on by casual data breaches and the complexity of online privacy control, can reduce users' attention to privacy issues.
Yet, being consistently exposed to a mismatch between what one hopes for and what the environment affords leads to increased psychological strain[^21].

Privacy fatigue is closely related to the concept of _learned helplessness_[^23].
Learned helplessness is the behavior exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control.
The subject affected by this phenomenon discontinues attempts to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented.
Learned helplessness is linked to a degraded self-efficacy - the individual's belief in their innate ability to achieve goals.
Researchers suggest that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may result from a real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation[^24].

Indeed, privacy is related to identity, and to our perception of our own competence to deal with the world[^1][^16].
Repetetive exposure to technological limitations[^19], as well as the privacy paradox attitude-behavior gap[^12] might situate the explanation of privacy fatigue in the scope of learned helplessness.


## Privacy Paradox

The privacy paradox is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not.[^12]
Anecdotal and empirical evidence indicates that individuals are willing to trade their personal information for relatively small rewards[^14].

However, as we have seen, privacy regulates the conflict of the need for connection with the need for competition, survival and overcoming the power diferential.Habits, and other needs, indeniably play a role in the persons choice of privacy related behavior and may yeald behavior inconsistent with the persons beliefs and interests (as outlined by the _privacy paradox_)[^18].

The existence of the privacy paradox is not indicative of a false concern for privacy, but rather of the context not favoring behavior aligned with this concern, as is common with attitude-behavior gap[^13].
Researchers consider privacy-oblivious behavior to be a result of technological limitations as much as a consequence of users' deficiencies[^19].


## Privacy in Software Systems

### Internet Systems are Tools For Connection

The rise of Internet Systems and of the Web is inspired by the concept of Memex, proposed by Vannevar Bush in 1945 in his article *As We May Think*[^25]. Memex is imagined as a tehorethical machine that humans can use to augment their cognitive powers. Memex can store information and provide access to it at later times. Also Memex is collaborative, as it can facilitate access to information provided by others - a *collective memory-extension tool*.

Memex was the inspiration for:
- NLS[^26], a system that used the early internet infrastructure to demonstrate the pioneering use of videoconferencing, collaborative document editing, hypermedia, document version control and many other concepts prevalent in modern Internet Systems. Developed in 1968, by Doug Engelbart, it was the first system to implement practical use of hypertext links[^27] for connecting information
- The Wrold Wide Web[^28], created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee

All of modern internet infrastructure and available applications and systems materialize the vision of Memex, where:
- human are connected to information,
- information is connected to information,
- humans are connected to humans.

### Control is Essential to Human-Computer Interactions

Having control (having the system respond predictably to user's actions) is one of the key features a user can expect from a properly designed human-computer interaction[^17].

Since *privacy is the selective **control** of access to the self*, a computer system, properly designed for connection, must also give the user control over their privacy.

### Privacy-enabled Connectedness

In essence, the available knowledge teaches us the following:
- **Internet Systems are tools for connection**
- **There is no connection without exposure of the self**
- **Privacy is the selective control of access to the self**
- **Properly designed computer systems put the user in control**
- **Privacy enables sustainable connection and trust (choosing to make something important to you vulnerable to the actions of someone else)**
- **Connectedness is dysfunctional without privacy** 

Therefore, we believe that a properly designed Internet System is designed for Privacy-enabled Connectedness. 

The Privacy-enabled Connectedness is achieved through the following design principles:
- **No Access without Control**. The system is designed to prevent any form of access to the user or to the user’s data without giving user the control over such access.

Examples:
A system collecting user’s data over a web form and storing the data unencrypted in a database is not designed to prevent any form of access to the user or to the user’s data without giving user the control over such access. A system collecting data end-to-end encrypted for clearly identified target consumers, is.

- **Distributed Control for Distributed Access**. A system collecting user’s data, that shares this data with other systems, is designed to propagate any access-related instruction given by the user across the receiving systems. (No loose ends)

Examples:
When a user deletes their data from one system, a properly designed system allows the user to have the delete action propagated to other systems to which the data was transmitted. A poorly designed system only deletes the data from its own storage.
