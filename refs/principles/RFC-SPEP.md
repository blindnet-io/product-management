## Introduction

Privacy is a complex yet essential component of human socialization.
Ever since software Systems became tools for human connectedness, a need emerged to engineer privacy in them.

[Academic research](../notion-of-privacy/notion-of-privacy.md) offers insight into the definition and function of privacy. Growing body of [regulation](#privacy-legislation) specifics how software Systems and Organizations operating them should behave in order to ensure privacy. Yet, it remains challenging for a software engineer to grasp all that information and translate it into design of a software System.

We propose simple engineering principles that embody key understandings of privacy in the context of software engineering.
While it is impossible to guarantee compliance with [regulation](#privacy-legislation) upfront, it is likely that Systems engineered in the spirit of these principles will reach compliance more easily than other systems, and natively cover major regulatory constraints.



## Terminology

- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)
- The key word "CAN" denotes ability of someone or something, and is interpreted as "MUST be able to"
- The key words "blindnet devkit", "CCPA", "CPRA", "Capture Fragment", "Component", "Data Capture", "Data Capture Fragment", "Data Consumer", "Data Subject", "DPO", "Fragment", "GDPR", "HIPPA", "Internet User", "Organization", "Privateform", "Privacy Request", "System", "Submitter", "User" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-Lexicon-2](../lexicon/RFC-Lexicon-2.md)
