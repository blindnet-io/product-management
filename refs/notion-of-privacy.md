## General Notion of Privacy

### Definition
Among the many definitions proposed in scientific literature, we use the following one:

> **“Privacy is the selective control of access to the self”** - *Irwin Altman[^1]*

This definition captures the essential fetures of the concept, in particular:
- Privacy is about the **self**.

The *self* is a very important element of human experience playing *"an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and social identity"*[^2]. 

The self is not the same as identity. While the *self is the totality of the individual*[^3], the *identity is an individual’s sense of self defined by (a) a set of physical, psychological, and interpersonal characteristics that is not wholly shared with any other person and (b) a range of affiliations (e.g., ethnicity) and social roles*[^4].

Some scientists challenge the ability of an indifidual to know the *self*, under which view the self might be only intelligible through its manifestations or consequences. It is generally accepted that the self is developed. Also, undoubtably, in part *"the self emerges through interaction with others"*[^5].

Due to the relational provenance of the knowledge of the self, privacy is one of the key features of the relationship of oneself with the surrounding world (other humans and artefacts) through which the knoweledge of the self is formed. Privacy is a "factor of connection to oneself and to others"[^6].


- Privacy is about **control of access**.

As relationships play a key role in shaping the view on the self, it is of crucial importance for the individual to control the access to self, and thus maintain control over the change of the self. That is the function of Privacy.


### Genesis and Function

Privacy seems to trace its origins in biological processes, and "withdrawal from others is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom"[^7]. Researchers make an anlogy with cell membrane[^1] that seletively allows material inputs and outputs, similarly as privacy selectively regulates external stimulation to one's self or the flow of information to others[^7].

Biology research [^7] suggests that, in social species, privacy might have emerged as the cost-benefit balance between the advantages offered by the life in a group and the interest of the individual's competition over scarce resources. The practice of witholding information or actively sending deceiving signals might have have origins in a survival mechanism.
