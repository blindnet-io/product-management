# US 01 Account management

**US-01-01.** _As an_ unregistered user, Amélie, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">I want to</span>_ create an account on PrivateForm by using email and password, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">because</span>_ I need to collect medical data from my patients.

**US-01-02.** As soon as I request to open an account, I want to personalize the user-facing web page for all forms with my business information: logo, business name (for display, optional), business address, business description (optional). 

**US-01-03.** As a logged user, paying a premium subscription, I want to configure my forms in such a way that they appear under my domain (or subdomain), and that all e-mail sent by PrivateForm is sent “from” an e-mail address belonging to my domain. . 

**US-01-04.** As a logged user, I want to edit my account information (password, email, payment).

**US-01-05.** As a logged user, I want to delete my account.

**US-01-06.** As a logged user, I forgot my password and want to gain access to my account :)

**US-01-07.** As a logged user,  I want to export all of my data (collected forms) decrypted, and have them stored somewhere else at my convenience.
