## 04-1 User

**US-04-1-00** As a user filling a form, I want to know how my data is going to be treated - what data is stored, where it is stored, for how long, who has access to it.

**US-04-1-01** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, I want to be able to ask to access my data because I want to see what data has been captured 

**US-04-1-02** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, I want to be able to ask to modify my data because I need to update an information

**US-04-1-04** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, I want to be able to find the touchpoint to create a GDPR request even if I submitted my form a long time ago because I might want to exercise my rights later

~~**US-04-1-05-1** (cf slide 21 Product Directions document) As a user filling a form, Jean-Pierre, I want to be able to receive a “personalized” form link that recognizes and captures my email address (no encryption?) so that at the end of the form, when I am informed about how I can exercise my GDPR rights, my e-mail address can be pre-filled and I can click on one button to send me the email containing this information of how I can exercise my GDPR rights , because it is an effort for me to input my e-mail address~~

~~**US-04-1-05-2** As a user filling a form, Jean-Pierre, if my email address is captured and pre-filled on the last page of the form (US-04-1-05-01) I want to know that my email address is the only data not encrypted because I might thought that is it~~

**US-04-1-06** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, I want to be able to send an identification ID document when I ask for my GDPR right to be exercised because I need to be identified if I want my request to be approved

**US-04-1-06-1** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, I want to know that when I am sending my ID document in order to exercise my GDPR rights, that my data is treated securely (who sees it, for how long, for what purpose it is needed), because I am privacy-concerned.

**US-04-1-07** As a user filling a form, Jean-Pierre, I want to know what data is collected by Amélie, what treatment is done with it, how long is she keeping which data, because I don’t trust Amélie and I want to be picky about my rights and appear smart.

**US-04-1-08** As a user filling a form, Jean-Pierre, I want to ask a question to Amélie regarding my data because I want to know more about the purpose of her data treatment.

**US-04-1-09** As a user filling a form, Jean-Pierre, I want to know where my data is stored because I don’t trust some companies and jurisdictions (e.g. Google and the USA).

**US-04-1-10** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, I made a data access/modification/deletion request more than a month ago, and I want to know what is going on with it, because I did not get a reply.

**US-04-1-11** As a user filling a form, Jean-Pierre, I want to know when my data will be deleted if I do nothing because I am lazy and I still want people to forget my data after a while and I know it is my right

~~**US-04-1-12** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, I want to know whether my data was automatically deleted, because the legal delay for holding them has expired.~~

**US-04-1-13** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, when I receive my data after I filed a data access request, I want to know that my data is delivered to me in a secure way so that only I can access it, because I have AIDS (written in my data records) and I don’t want anyone to know it.

**US-04-1-14** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, when I receive my data after I filed a data access request, I want to download/print my data, because I want to send it to another doctor.

**US-04-1-15** As a user who submitted a form in the past, Jean-Pierre, my data deletion request is denied and I want to know why because I think I have the right to have my data deleted.

**US-04-1-16** As a user who submitted several different form in the past (e.g. Covid and Medical History), Jean-Pierre, I want to modify some data that are only on one of the forms I submitted because something has changed in my life
