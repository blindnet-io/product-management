# User Stories

## What is a User Story

A User Story is a general explanation of a feature from the user perspective, in natural/informal language. In one sentence, a user story will describe user type, what that user wants, and why. 

The objective of crafting User stories is to be able to rely on it to plan and implement new features and design.

## How to craft User Stories

Here, our personas are :

* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Amélie</span>, the client of our system (eg. the dentist)
* <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Jean-Pierre</span>, the user filling the form (eg. the patient)

:arrow_right: Put yourself in Amélie and Jean-Pierre shoes and imagine the goals they would like to achieve in PrivateForm for Amélie, while filling the forms for Jean-Pierre. 

:arrow_right: Think of what would need Amélie while using PrivateForm and what would need Jean-Pierre while/after filling the form 

:arrow_right: Make sure no similar user story has been written already

:arrow_right: Use the following structure : _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">As a</span>_ **[type of user]**, _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">I want to</span>_ **[the goal]** _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">because</span>_ **[the benefit, the reason]**

:arrow_right: Each User Story has a unique ID, in the following structure “US-XX-YY” where XX is the number of the section and YY is the number of the user story within that section
