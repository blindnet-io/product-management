# US 02 Form Management

**US-02-01.** As a logged user, I want to pick one or more predefined forms from the form library to add to my account main page so I can send them to my clients. 

**US-02-02.** As a logged user, I want to send a request to blindnet to build a customized form to send to my clients. In the request, I am going to add a description of the form I need.

**US-02-03.** As a logged user, I want to import the custom form I requested using the file I was given by the blindnet team.

**US-02-04.** As a logged user, I want to setsend an expiration date for each submitted form (auto-destruction).

**US-02-05.** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to copy the link of a form available on my account, because I want to send these links to Jean-Pierre.

**US-02-06.** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to send a request to Jean-Pierre to fill out a chosen form directly from PrivateForm, because I don’t want to open my own email client for that. 

**US-02-07.** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to specify Jean-Pierre's name, email, and date/time of the appointment when emailing him the link to the questionnaire, because Jean-Pierre needs to see these details in a received email and feel positive about the text.

**US-02-08.** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to review the content of the form Jean-Pierre sent me, and if needed modify things and save them because Jean-Pierre might communicate new information to me during his visit.

**US-02-09.** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to be reminded to save modifications I made to the form Jean-Pierre sent me because I might forget otherwise.

**US-02-10.** As a logged user, Amélie, I want easily download one or more files that are asked in my formes, and then import them to some other system, because I am collecting employee health insurance cards, bank account numbers and I need to use that information in my payslip and banking software applications.

**US-02-11.** As a logged user, I want to be notified when a new form is submitted. 

**US-02-12.** As a logged user, I want to be able to delete a form, because legal conservation due date is past and I no longer need that data
