**because** I need to keep track of them for legal reason or I might need to give to my boss or colleague

## US-08-07

**As a** Data Consumer, receiving a Privacy request containing mulitple demands

**because** I want to know of such recommendations and react to them

## US-08-16

**As a** Data Consumer,

**I want** to search for a particular Data Subject among my Privacy requests history and filter only their Privacy requests 

**because** I have a long Privacy request history and it is not convenient to try to spot the name of the Data Subject I am looking for by scrolling among my Privacy request history

## US-08-17

**As a** Data Consumer, receiving a Privacy Request that I need to share with a Partner organization

**I want** to be able to easily forward the Privacy request to that Partner organization, by configuring a setting to automatically forward such request with contact of all my Partner organizations and/or being able to explicitely forward it on the interface with the possibility of configuring sugesstion to whom forward the request with contact of all my Partner organizations

**because** I want to save time and effort regarding Privacy request transfer

## US-08-18

**As a** Data Consumer, receiving a Privacy Request transmitted from a Partner organization

**I want** to know and see on the Privacy request the detail that the request is not direclty coming from the Data Subject but from a transfer by a Partner organization

**because** in that case I might want to reply to the Partner organization and not directly to the Data Subject

**As an** Organization, using blindnet devkit to automate the processing of requests

**I want to** automate a maximum of requests except the "other" type of request that I need to process manually

**because** I want to save time and effort

## US-08-21 - other (not part of interface per se)

**As a** developper from an Organization, using blindnet devkit

**I want to** I want it to automatically compute the responses to (at least some) requests such as information about server locations, privacy policy, data types, organisation identity etc (cf. list of TRANSPARENCY actions from the [PRIV examples](https://github.com/blindnet-io/product-management/blob/main/refs/schemas/priv/dictionary/actions/en.actions.json))

**because** I want to save time and effort

## US-08-22 - other (not part of interface per se)

**As a** developper from an Organization, using blindnet devkit

**I want to** be able to configure which requests / which demands (inside a request containing multiple demands) are processed automatically, and which are processed using human validation (Privacy Computation Engine gives a recommendation but a human - Data Consumer/DPO accepts or rjects it)

**because** some of the requests can be processed automatically, some others cannot and need human validation
