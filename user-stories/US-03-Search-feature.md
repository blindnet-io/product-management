**US-03-01** As a logged user, Amélie, while welcoming Jean-Pierre at my office I want to check if Jean-Pierre submitted a form prior to his visit because I don’t see his name in the list of recently received forms. I don’t care about the content, I just want to know if the form is there.

**US-03-02** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to retrieve Jean-Pierre’s data by searching for keyword because I have a long list of user data and it is too complicated to scroll and spot the one I am looking for 

**US-03-03** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to be able to process a fuzzy search by the first letters of the name or surname of Jean-Pierre’s data beauce that the information I have to retrieve his data

**US-03-04** As a logged user, Amélie, I remember Jean-Peirre sent me a form a few months ago, but now I want to make sure I’ve received a new form because I expect another visit from Jean-Pierre.

**US-03-05** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to search for all the forms submitted by Jean-Pierre, and see submission dates and form types because I want to check Jean-Pierre filled-out both forms I asked him to fill-out.

**US-03-06** As a logged user, Amélie, I am speaking on the form with Jean-Pierre who asks me to confirm if I received his form. I want to search for all the forms with similar-sounding surnames that I can type, because Jean-Pierre has a very strange surname that I am not sure how to spell and I don’t hear him very well. I am not even sure what is his name and what is surname TBH.

**US-03-07** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to see the list of all forms submitted by a specific user, because I have an appointment with a specific user and I need a “user view” to check specific user history 

**US-03-08** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to search by date and period of time, because I need to check the forms submitted between specific period of time (ex: from year X to year Y)

**US-03-09** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to search by email address, because I might have homonyms user names and/or the same user might have submitted different forms with different email addresses. 

**US-03-10** As a logged user, Amélie, I want to sort the search results (list of forms) by ascending or descending date order because I might need to view the last forms submitted or the first forms submitted
