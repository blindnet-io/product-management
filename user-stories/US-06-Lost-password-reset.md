## US-06-01

**As a** registered user,

**I want to** be able to reset my password,

**because** I have lost it

## US-06-02

**As a** registered user

**I want to** make sure I can access my data again in case of password loss

**because** I might loose my password

## US-06-03

**As a** registered user in a multi user context

**I want to** make sure the users of my organisation can access their account again in case of password loss even if they don't set up reset password procedure

**because** they might don't set up reset password procedure and still expect they can access their account again in case of password loss

## US-06-04

**As a** registered user 

**I want to** be informed I have to set up a reset password procedure in case of password loss

**because** I might think I don't need to do anything, that there is a default procedure allowing to access my account again in case of loss password

## US-06-05

**As a** trusted contact

**I want to** know who asks me to be a trusted, why I am being asked to be a trusted contact, and what I need to do

**because** I might not be aware of this kind of procedure 

## US-06-06

**As a** logged user who asked someone to be a trusted contact

**I want to** know when the trusted has completed the procedure 

**because** I might think the procedure is set up while in reality there is a missing step 

## US-06-07

**As a** logged user of single account 

**I want to** know I can set up trusted contacts settings for the organisation when I add a new user

**because** I might think all users can only set up trusted contacts themselves 

## US-06-08

**As a** logged user

**I want to** be able to add several trusted contacts

**because** I want to make sure I can access my account again if one of my trusted contact fails

## US-06-09

**As a** logged user

**I want to** be able to add several trusted contacts

**because** I want to make sure I can access my account again if one of my trusted contact fails
